- Man, 27. From sweden.

- Currently studying mechanical engineering at Örebro University.

- Lives in student apartment with a first hand contract.

- Did not live here before attending University.
  
  - Had to find someone renting out second hand. I managed to find one through Blocket. Later turned out that tenant overcharged for it and lacked permission from landlord.
  
  - Had no choice but to accept the circumstances as it was too difficult and time consuming to find a better alternative at the moment.

- Signed up to all available housing queues in the city right after having received the university admission results.

- School did not offer any help related to finding accomodation.

### From a student perspective:

***Did you live in Gothenburg before starting to study? 
Moving to ~~Gothenburg~~ as a student, how did you first find housing?
Was it difficult?***

Did not live here before attending University.

- Had to find someone renting out second hand. I managed to find one through Blocket. Later turned out that tenant overcharged for it and lacked permission from landlord.

- Had no choice but to accept the circumstances as it was too difficult and time consuming to find a better alternative at the moment.

***Did you sign up for any housing queues early?***

Signed up to all available housing queues in the city right after having received the university admission results.

***Did the school help you in any kind of way?***

School did not offer any help related to finding accomodation.

***What were the top three priorities when you were searching for your first student accommodation in Sweden?***

- Not too expensive.

- [can't remember or did not have any other specific priorities]

***Could you name something positive/negative you feel about the Swedish queuing system?***

No bias in regards to who is offered a contract, altough other factors such as the locals being more likely to prepare for the likelihood of needing one in the future.

***Is there anything you feel like is missing from housing pages, such as SGS or boplats?***

Probability of finding an apartment given different queue times. Would help when deciding how to allocate the short time you might have to find housing. [I.e., is it worth to even apply to any of these ads considering my queue time?

***Is there something you feel like is particularly great about housing pages, such as SGS or boplats?***

Does not assoicate housing pages with something great in general.

***[Present our idea, response?]***

***Would you have been interested in using such a system? Do you think such a system would be effective?***

Could be interesting if no other choice to consider. Efficiency hard to assess without a reasonably detailed prototype at hands.

***Have you ever used similar systems, such as airbnb or couchsurfer before?
Why/why not?***

Never had the need to.

Why/why not?

***What do you feel would be your biggest worry if you were to use our system?***

Home owners.

***If you were to use our system, what aspects of the accommodation would you mostly be concerned by (location, cost, size…)?***

Reliability of the provided information and home owner. Would not want the possibility of any complicated situations to arise as it could leave you being without any place to stay.

***What do you feel like the home owner should offer you in order for you to feel safe and secure when renting?***

Identification to confirm it is the same person as listed on the platform. Also information that can be used to assess if this person can be trusted (i.e., an extract from the *criminal records* registry, results of a recent psychological evaluation, etc..)

***Could you see yourself as someone who temporarily could sleep on someone’s couch or smaller room until finding something proper?***

Only if I personally know them.

***Is sharing something you would consider possible as a first housing option in Gothenburg?***

Highly questionable - maybe as a last resort if I were desperate enoguh.

***Is there a preferred language you would like the system to be in? Would your native language help more as opposed to English?***

Swedish/English does not really matter, altough swedish could make it more apparent early on that it is aimed at housing in sweden.

### From a home owner perspective

***Have you ever rented out any part of your current or previous accommodation before?
Why/why not?***

No, but have offered [free] temporary accomodation to friends who had no where else to go.

***Would you see it as a potential option and opportunity to make some money out of it?***

Probably not, already well off financially. - If anything it would be to .. with a sudden need, and without any form of compensation required.

***[Present our idea, response?]***

***If used, did you feel like something was missing from these systems?
If used, is there any part of these systems you feel like were great features?***

Wouldn't know until I try it.

***What do you feel would be your biggest worry if you were to use our system?***

Immature students etc

***If you were to use our system, what aspects of renting out the accommodation would you find most important (having someone to stay every available date, what student gets to rent, or maybe getting paid the most)?***

--

***What are some requirements you would have on your tenant?***

Being orderly, reliable and so on.

***What do you feel like the student should offer you in order for you to feel safe and secure when renting?***

[mostly same as if the situtation was turned]
